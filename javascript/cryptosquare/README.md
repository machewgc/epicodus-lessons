## Synopsis

This is a program that encodes a message in cryptosquare.

## Code Example

N/A

## Motivation

To get practice writing programs in js

## Tests

The size of the square (number of columns) should be decided by the length of the message. If the message is a length that creates a perfect square (e.g. 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, etc), use that number of columns. If the message doesn't fit neatly into a square, choose the number of columns that corresponds to the smallest square that is larger than the number of characters in the message.
  Example input: 12 12
  Example output: 1122

  Example input: 1234 1234 1234 1234
  Example output: 11112 22233 3344
  
Output the encoded text in groups of five letters.
