MakeChange includes a method that takes an amount of money less than $1 and returns the smallest number of coins necessary to create that amount.

Acceptable inputs:
If a number less than 0.01 is entered, the user will be asked to enter another number.
If a non number is entered, the user will be asked to enter a two-digit decimal greater than .00.
If the number is greater than 1, the number will be truncated and the decimals only will be used.

Logic:
For amounts less than $0.05, the coins will be equal to the amount of cents and the only coin used will be a penny.
  Example input: 0.04
  Example output: 4 pennies
For amounts between $0.05 and $0.10, one nickel will be returned along with the number of cents minus five in pennies. A comma will separate the types of coins required.
  Example input: 0.09
  Example output: 1 nickel, 4 pennies
For amounts greater than $0.10 and less than $0.25, at least one dime will be returned.
  Example input: 0.15
  Example output: 1 dime, 1 nickel
For amounts greater than $0.25, at least one quarter will be returned since it is the largest coin. No other coin is guaranteed to be returned.
  Example input: 0.67
  Example output: 2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel, 2 pennies
