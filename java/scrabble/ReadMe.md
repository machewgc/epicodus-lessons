This Java program returns the value of an input string using the following scoring system:
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10

The program sorts through each letter to determine the value and adds the value of that letter to the word's total value.

Words containing only letters with a value of 1 will be equal in value to the length of the word. The value of each letter will be matched using regular expressions for brevity of code.
